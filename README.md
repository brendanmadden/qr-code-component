## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used this project to refresh my basic HTML and CSS. I used semantic HTML, some custom properties, and flexbox. It was a great flexbox refresher, and I had a lot of fun building a [Frontend Mentor](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) project for the first time in over a year!

### Continued development

I would like to continue to improve my semantic, and accessible HTML use. I'm looking forward to building more Frontend Mentor Projects, and within a few months I would like to build a full-stack site from a project.

### Useful resources

- [Pixel to REM Converter](https://nekocalc.com/px-to-rem-converter) - This is a great resource I use on most projects for any conversions I might need.
